Smart study website is useful for students for increasing the productivity of study.Many of the students face problems in remembering what they studied even though it is read 'n' times.Therefore to study effectively students have to try to think and rethink,thus rewinding what they have learnt.It uses the method of spaced repetition schedule and active recall.Spaced repetition algorithm can be implemented using flashcards.Flash cards can be implemented using python.This website helps students to search their study topic and it provides notes using flashcards.First the student can search for a particular topic for their study purpose and the available flashcards regarding this topic will be appearing.Using web scraping, we can extract data from any URL or site.Also the student can create new flashcards on any topic.
   Front-end is done using html and css.Flashcards are created using python functions.
   Both front-end and python is interfaced using flask.Web scraping is done using scrapy by creating spiders which crawls the website.
   Data is first stored as json/csv/xml file.Then data is stored in Mysql in mysql workbench to make it into tabular form.Sql commands are given in pipeline python page of spider
